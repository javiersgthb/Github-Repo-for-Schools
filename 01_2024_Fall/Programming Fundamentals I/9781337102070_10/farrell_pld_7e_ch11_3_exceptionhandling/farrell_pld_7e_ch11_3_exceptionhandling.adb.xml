    <p begin="00:00:00.54" dur="00:00:02.20">&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.74" dur="00:00:02.47">Let's take a look at<br/>exception handling.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:05.21" dur="00:00:03.29">Let's look at a short program<br/>that computes a percent.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.50" dur="00:00:04.03">For example, you might declare<br/>points earned on a quiz,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:12.53" dur="00:00:03.04">points passable for the<br/>entire quiz, and percent,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.57" dur="00:00:02.63">which is a ratio<br/>between those two values.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:18.20" dur="00:00:01.44">When you make these<br/>declarations,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:19.64" dur="00:00:02.48">three spots are set<br/>up in memory.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.12" dur="00:00:03.40">You then might prompt the user<br/>to enter the points earned.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.52" dur="00:00:04.23">And you might input a four to<br/>the points earned variable.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:29.75" dur="00:00:02.33">Then you might prompt<br/>enter points possible.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:32.08" dur="00:00:02.19">And suppose the user<br/>types a five.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.27" dur="00:00:03.33">You'd put five in the<br/>points possible variable.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:37.60" dur="00:00:01.71">Then the arithmetic<br/>would consist</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.31" dur="00:00:02.88">of dividing points<br/>earned by points passable,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.19" dur="00:00:02.25">or four divided by five.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:44.44" dur="00:00:02.81">Percent would be point 80.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:47.25" dur="00:00:03.23">Then to output it, you<br/>might multiply it by 100,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:50.48" dur="00:00:02.48">so the answer would<br/>be percent is 80.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.96" dur="00:00:02.83">The program would end normally.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.79" dur="00:00:02.23">Now suppose something<br/>goes wrong.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.02" dur="00:00:03.37">Suppose when you run the<br/>program, the user puts in a four</p>
    <p begin="00:01:01.39" dur="00:00:03.54">for points earned, and it's<br/>stored, and then the user puts</p>
    <p begin="00:01:04.93" dur="00:00:03.90">in zero for points<br/>possible, and it's stored.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:08.83" dur="00:00:04.11">When you do the arithmetic,<br/>you're dividing four by zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:12.94" dur="00:00:02.51">In every programming<br/>language, dividing four</p>
    <p begin="00:01:15.45" dur="00:00:04.04">by zero is an illegal operation.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:19.49" dur="00:00:02.33">An exception is generated.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:21.82" dur="00:00:02.59">In object-oriented<br/>programming languages,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:24.41" dur="00:00:01.85">programmers call the error</p>
    <p begin="00:01:26.26" dur="00:00:03.20">that is generated<br/>an exception object.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:29.46" dur="00:00:04.50">And they say that it's thrown<br/>to someplace that can handle it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:33.96" dur="00:00:03.54">This program has indicated no<br/>special place to handle it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:37.50" dur="00:00:02.22">So in this case, the<br/>exception is thrown</p>
    <p begin="00:01:39.72" dur="00:00:02.29">to the operating system.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:42.01" dur="00:00:02.97">And there, a message<br/>is generated.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:44.98" dur="00:00:03.02">The message will be different in<br/>different programming languages.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:48.00" dur="00:00:01.38">But basically, it will say</p>
    <p begin="00:01:49.38" dur="00:00:04.76">that this is an unhandled<br/>exception, divisioned by zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:54.14" dur="00:00:03.66">You might choose instead<br/>to handle the exception.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:57.80" dur="00:00:03.16">In that case, you can add<br/>a triblock to your program.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.96" dur="00:00:03.56">A triblock is a block of code<br/>in which you put statements</p>
    <p begin="00:02:04.52" dur="00:00:02.87">that might generate<br/>an exception.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:07.39" dur="00:00:01.91">You then can add a catch block.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:09.30" dur="00:00:02.27">A catch block contains<br/>statements that you want</p>
    <p begin="00:02:11.57" dur="00:00:03.36">to have execute if an<br/>exception is generated.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:14.93" dur="00:00:02.41">In this example,<br/>in the triblock,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:17.34" dur="00:00:03.53">you'd put the arithmetic that<br/>might cause division by zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:20.87" dur="00:00:03.33">And in the catch block, perhaps<br/>you'd say set the percent</p>
    <p begin="00:02:24.20" dur="00:00:01.86">to zero, if that happens.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:26.06" dur="00:00:01.55">You could put different<br/>statements here.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:27.61" dur="00:00:01.27">You might want to<br/>set the percent</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.88" dur="00:00:01.66">to a different default value.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:30.54" dur="00:00:02.55">Or you might want to<br/>re-prompt the user.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:33.09" dur="00:00:03.11">You put in the catch block<br/>whatever you want to have happen</p>
    <p begin="00:02:36.20" dur="00:00:02.09">if the exception is thrown.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:38.29" dur="00:00:02.56">After the triblock<br/>and the catch block,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:40.85" dur="00:00:03.15">you can finish the program<br/>and output the results.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:02.78">So when you run this<br/>program and prompt the user</p>
    <p begin="00:02:46.78" dur="00:00:02.85">for points earned, the<br/>user might still type four,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:49.63" dur="00:00:01.38">and it will be stored.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:51.01" dur="00:00:02.16">And when you say<br/>enter points possible,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:53.17" dur="00:00:03.45">the user might still type<br/>zero, and it will be stored.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:56.62" dur="00:00:02.06">This time, when you<br/>do the arithmetic,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:58.68" dur="00:00:02.51">the exception is<br/>still generated.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:01.19" dur="00:00:02.09">But because it's in a triblock,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:03.28" dur="00:00:03.29">the exception can be<br/>thrown to a catch block.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:06.57" dur="00:00:02.96">So when the exception<br/>goes to the catch block,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:09.53" dur="00:00:04.58">the catch block executes, and<br/>the percent is set to zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:14.11" dur="00:00:06.81">Then the output can be percent<br/>is 0 times 100, or percent is 0.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:20.92" dur="00:00:02.00">Let's look at the program again.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:22.92" dur="00:00:02.40">Enter points earned, four.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:25.32" dur="00:00:02.53">Enter points possible, five.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:27.85" dur="00:00:03.20">In this case, when you<br/>get to the triblock,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:31.05" dur="00:00:01.26">the points earned divided</p>
    <p begin="00:03:32.31" dur="00:00:03.19">by points possible is<br/>a legitimate value.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:35.50" dur="00:00:04.77">In this case, the catch block<br/>is bypassed, and you can just go</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.27" dur="00:00:04.54">to output the result,<br/>percent is 80.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:44.81" dur="00:00:01.36">Thanks for watching.</p>
