    <p begin="00:00:00.45" dur="00:00:02.11">&gt;&gt;Hi, this is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.56" dur="00:00:02.39">Let's<br/>look at creating a class.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:04.95" dur="00:00:02.59">Suppose you decide to start<br/>a house sitting business</p>
    <p begin="00:00:07.54" dur="00:00:01.13">and you decide that one</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.67" dur="00:00:02.76">of the classes you'll need<br/>is a house sitting contract</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.43" dur="00:00:02.44">that holds data about<br/>each contract you have</p>
    <p begin="00:00:13.87" dur="00:00:01.19">with the client.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.06" dur="00:00:01.72">You might decide<br/>some of the data</p>
    <p begin="00:00:16.78" dur="00:00:03.87">that you'll need is a clients<br/>name as a string and the number</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.65" dur="00:00:03.30">of days of the contract<br/>as a numeric variable.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:23.95" dur="00:00:03.36">Typically when you create<br/>a class you make most data</p>
    <p begin="00:00:27.31" dur="00:00:01.53">to be private.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.84" dur="00:00:02.87">Making the data private<br/>constructs a sort of barrier</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.71" dur="00:00:04.55">around it that prevents outside<br/>classes or outside programs</p>
    <p begin="00:00:36.26" dur="00:00:02.20">from using the data in any way</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.46" dur="00:00:02.51">that the class has<br/>not approved of.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:40.97" dur="00:00:02.78">For example, suppose<br/>you start a program</p>
    <p begin="00:00:43.75" dur="00:00:04.62">and you declare a house sitting<br/>contract object, named contract.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:48.37" dur="00:00:04.36">If you decide to assign a<br/>value to contract.client,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.73" dur="00:00:04.10">when you attempt to access<br/>the client, you can't get in.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:56.83" dur="00:00:01.23">The data is private.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.06" dur="00:00:03.20">This statement is illegal.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:01.26" dur="00:00:03.38">Instead what you have to do<br/>is create a method with a name</p>
    <p begin="00:01:04.64" dur="00:00:04.22">like set client that can accept<br/>a clients name as a parameter</p>
    <p begin="00:01:08.86" dur="00:00:02.38">and make the assignment.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:11.24" dur="00:00:05.40">This method is public, meaning<br/>an outside program can use it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:16.64" dur="00:00:04.37">So in your program if you say,<br/>contract.set client and pass</p>
    <p begin="00:01:21.01" dur="00:00:04.43">in an argument, this is a<br/>call to the set client method.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:25.44" dur="00:00:03.53">The name is passed in as<br/>a parameter to the method.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:28.97" dur="00:00:03.04">The method makes the assignment<br/>and the method is allowed</p>
    <p begin="00:01:32.01" dur="00:00:02.98">to make the assignment because<br/>it's part of the same class.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:34.99" dur="00:00:06.14">A class method can get<br/>at its own classes data.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:41.13" dur="00:00:04.02">Here's a more detailed public<br/>method called set days.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:45.15" dur="00:00:04.49">It accepts the number of days in<br/>a contract and assigns it only</p>
    <p begin="00:01:49.64" dur="00:00:02.67">if it's within the proper range.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:52.31" dur="00:00:03.13">This method declares a maximum<br/>number of days and checks</p>
    <p begin="00:01:55.44" dur="00:00:03.96">to make sure the days passed<br/>and don't exceed that.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:59.40" dur="00:00:04.20">This is a better example of<br/>why you sometimes want methods</p>
    <p begin="00:02:03.60" dur="00:00:03.45">to protect your private<br/>data from being set in ways</p>
    <p begin="00:02:07.05" dur="00:00:02.91">that the class does<br/>not agree with.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:09.96" dur="00:00:02.68">So if you make a<br/>statement in your program</p>
    <p begin="00:02:12.64" dur="00:00:04.05">like contract set days,<br/>this calls the public method</p>
    <p begin="00:02:16.69" dur="00:00:03.21">and sends in the<br/>argument as a parameter.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:19.90" dur="00:00:03.99">The parameter can then be<br/>assigned and the method can get</p>
    <p begin="00:02:23.89" dur="00:00:04.16">at its own data and<br/>make the assignment.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.05" dur="00:00:01.92">Here's a statement that attempts</p>
    <p begin="00:02:29.97" dur="00:00:03.37">to output the contracts<br/>clients name.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:33.34" dur="00:00:03.54">When you try to get the<br/>clients name, it can't get</p>
    <p begin="00:02:36.88" dur="00:00:03.41">out because the data is private.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:40.29" dur="00:00:02.80">This is an illegal statement.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:43.09" dur="00:00:01.83">Instead, what you might want</p>
    <p begin="00:02:44.92" dur="00:00:02.99">to do is add a public<br/>method called get client</p>
    <p begin="00:02:47.91" dur="00:00:04.97">that returns the clients<br/>name to an outside program.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:52.88" dur="00:00:04.01">You might add a name to<br/>your program, a string,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:56.89" dur="00:00:03.32">and then you might<br/>assign contract.get client</p>
    <p begin="00:03:00.21" dur="00:00:01.52">to that name.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:01.73" dur="00:00:04.57">Contract.get client is a<br/>method call and the method</p>
    <p begin="00:03:06.30" dur="00:00:02.52">in the class can<br/>access its own data</p>
    <p begin="00:03:08.82" dur="00:00:03.57">and that can be returned<br/>to the outside.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:12.39" dur="00:00:02.94">Then you might output the name.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:15.33" dur="00:00:02.22">Incidentally these<br/>two statements,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:17.55" dur="00:00:02.43">name equals contract.get client</p>
    <p begin="00:03:19.98" dur="00:00:03.49">and then output name could<br/>be combined into one,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:23.47" dur="00:00:04.68">output contract.get client.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:28.15" dur="00:00:02.14">You could add another<br/>public method to your class</p>
    <p begin="00:03:30.29" dur="00:00:01.46">to return the private days</p>
    <p begin="00:03:31.75" dur="00:00:03.82">and then you could output<br/>the days within the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:35.57" dur="00:00:02.71">When you finish a class you<br/>typically add an end class</p>
    <p begin="00:03:38.28" dur="00:00:02.34">statement and when you finish<br/>your program, of course,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.62" dur="00:00:02.94">you typically add<br/>a stop statement.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:43.56" dur="00:00:04.53">That's a quick look at<br/>creating and using a class.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:48.09" dur="00:00:00.96">Thanks for watching.</p>
