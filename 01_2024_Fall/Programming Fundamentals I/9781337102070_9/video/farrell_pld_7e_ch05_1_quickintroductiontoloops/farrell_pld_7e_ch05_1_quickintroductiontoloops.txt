    Here's a quick introduction to loops. 

    A loop structure executes continuously while some 

    condition remains true. 

    For example, suppose you ask a question, 

    &quot;Are you still mad at me?&quot; 

    The result is a Boolean answer, 

    yes or no, true or false. 

    Suppose the answer is yes. 

    Something must change and then the question can be asked again, 

    &quot;Are you still made at me?&quot; 

    Suppose the answer is yes. 

    Then something must change and you can ask the question again. 

    While the answer remains yes, something must change 

    and you can ask the question again. 

    When the answer is no, the loop ends. 

    The loop continues while the condition was true. 

    Thanks for watching.
