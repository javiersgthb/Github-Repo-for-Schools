    Let's talk about the program development cycle. 

    When you start to write a computer program, you first must 

    understand the problem. 

    For example, suppose a friend comes to you and says, 

    &quot;You know I run a small accounting firm, 

    and people keep stopping in the office and asking me 

    to multiply numbers by 2 for them. So far I've been happy 

    to do it, but it's taking up a lot of my time, 

    and I was thinking maybe we could automate the process 

    by writing a program and letting my clients use it and put 

    in their own numbers and have the program multiply numbers 

    by 2 for them.&quot; 

    Once you've understood the problem, you are ready 

    to plan the logic for this computer program. 

    When programmers plan the logic 

    for a program they typically use 1 of 2 tools. 

    They either write pseudocode or they draw a flowchart. 

    The pseudocode for the number doubling problem might look 

    like this: you would say start 

    and then you would say input myNumber. 

    myNumber would just be a name you have chosen for a spot 

    in memory where the user's number is stored. 

    Then you might put a statement in like, 

    set myAnswer equals myNumber times 2. 

    myAnswer would be another name you have chosen for a spot 

    in memory where the answer would be stored. 

    Then you could output myAnswer 

    so the user would see the result and stop the program. 

    Instead of writing this pseudocode, you might prefer 

    to draw a flowchart. 

    If you drew a flowchart for the number-doubling program you 

    would use a start symbol, then use an input symbol 

    to say input myNumber. 

    You'd add a processing symbol in which you set myAnswer equal 

    to myNumber times 2, add an output symbol 

    where you output the value of myAnswer and stop the program. 

    If you look at the flowchart and the pseudocode side- 

    by-side you can see that they contain exactly the same steps. 

    One is in a more pictorial form. The other is more 

    in paragraph form, but both get a number, double it, 

    and produce the answer. 

    After you've planned the logic for a computer program, you need 

    to write the code, which means writing the program 

    in a computer programming language, 

    then you translate the code into machine language 

    that the computer can understand, 

    you test the program, then you put the program 

    into production, and, finally, you maintain the program. 

    We will talk about these last 5 steps in the next 2 videos. 

    Thanks for watching.
