    <p begin="00:00:00.76" dur="00:00:01.94">&gt;&gt; Joyce Farrell: Hi,<br/>this is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.70" dur="00:00:03.52">Let's look in depth at<br/>AND and OR decisions.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:06.22" dur="00:00:03.39">With an AND decision, two<br/>conditions must be true</p>
    <p begin="00:00:09.61" dur="00:00:04.18">to result in an action; for<br/>example, in your company,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:13.79" dur="00:00:03.72">if a customer's amount<br/>due is greater than 10,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:17.51" dur="00:00:04.26">AND the customer is past due<br/>more than 15 days, then you want</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.77" dur="00:00:02.10">to assign a penalty<br/>to the customer.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:23.87" dur="00:00:01.80">That's an AND selection.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.67" dur="00:00:04.67">You can use the AND<br/>operator to combine operands</p>
    <p begin="00:00:30.34" dur="00:00:01.80">to make an AND selection.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:32.14" dur="00:00:04.19">For example, you can ask in a<br/>single question amount greater</p>
    <p begin="00:00:36.33" dur="00:00:03.28">than 10 AND past<br/>due greater than 15.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.61" dur="00:00:01.76">If so, assign a penalty.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.37" dur="00:00:04.58">A truth table helps you<br/>understand operations;</p>
    <p begin="00:00:45.95" dur="00:00:04.01">for example, if x is<br/>true and y is true,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.96" dur="00:00:03.07">then the expression<br/>x and y is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:53.03" dur="00:00:03.43">For example if it's true that<br/>you like chocolate and it's true</p>
    <p begin="00:00:56.46" dur="00:00:02.94">that you like coconut,<br/>then it's true that you'll</p>
    <p begin="00:00:59.40" dur="00:00:03.19">like my chocolate<br/>and coconut dessert.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:02.59" dur="00:00:03.06">If x is true and y is false,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:05.65" dur="00:00:02.73">then the expression<br/>x and y is false.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:08.38" dur="00:00:02.59">If you like chocolate but<br/>you don't like coconut,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:10.97" dur="00:00:01.81">you're not going to<br/>like the combination</p>
    <p begin="00:01:12.78" dur="00:00:01.76">coconut/chocolate dessert.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:14.54" dur="00:00:05.24">If x is false and y is true,<br/>again x and y is false.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:19.78" dur="00:00:02.72">If you don't like chocolate<br/>but you do like coconut,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:22.50" dur="00:00:01.38">you're not going to<br/>like the dessert.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:23.88" dur="00:00:02.88">And if x is false<br/>and y is false,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:26.76" dur="00:00:03.02">then the whole expression<br/>x and y is false.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:29.78" dur="00:00:02.34">If you don't like either<br/>part of the combination,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:32.12" dur="00:00:01.56">you're not going to<br/>like the dessert.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:33.68" dur="00:00:05.30">You can use 1s and 0s to<br/>represent true and false;</p>
    <p begin="00:01:38.98" dur="00:00:03.54">for example, if x is true<br/>and y is true, you can think</p>
    <p begin="00:01:42.52" dur="00:00:01.83">of them both as value 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:44.35" dur="00:00:03.17">The AND operator works<br/>like multiplication,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:47.52" dur="00:00:03.30">so when you multiply<br/>1 by 1 you get 1,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:50.82" dur="00:00:04.30">which is a true answer.However,<br/>if you multiply 1</p>
    <p begin="00:01:55.12" dur="00:00:03.20">by 0, it's a false answer.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:58.32" dur="00:00:04.89">And if you multiply 0 by 1,<br/>again, it's a false answer.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:03.21" dur="00:00:04.46">And false times false,<br/>0 times 0, once again,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:07.67" dur="00:00:02.46">is a false combination.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:10.13" dur="00:00:02.91">So in short, using<br/>the AND operator,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:13.04" dur="00:00:05.77">both x and y must be true for<br/>an entire expression to be true.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:18.81" dur="00:00:03.22">With an OR selection, either<br/>of two conditions must be true</p>
    <p begin="00:02:22.03" dur="00:00:03.55">to result in an action; for<br/>example, perhaps the policy</p>
    <p begin="00:02:25.58" dur="00:00:02.87">at your company is if a<br/>customer's amount due is greater</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.45" dur="00:00:04.07">than ten, then assign a<br/>penalty to the customer's total.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:32.52" dur="00:00:03.96">Otherwise, if the customer<br/>is past due greater than 15,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:36.48" dur="00:00:02.88">then assign a penalty<br/>to the customer's total.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:39.36" dur="00:00:02.14">One OR the other must be true</p>
    <p begin="00:02:41.50" dur="00:00:01.86">for the customer<br/>to get the penalty.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:43.36" dur="00:00:04.51">You can use an OR operator<br/>to combine two expressions</p>
    <p begin="00:02:47.87" dur="00:00:05.09">into one, amount greater than<br/>10 OR past due greater than 15.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:52.96" dur="00:00:04.18">If the entire expression is<br/>true, assign the penalty.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:57.14" dur="00:00:03.23">Here's the truth table<br/>for the OR operator.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:00.37" dur="00:00:04.24">If x is true and y is<br/>true, then x or y is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:04.61" dur="00:00:04.98">If x is true and y is false,<br/>then x or y is still true,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:09.59" dur="00:00:01.72">only one of them has to be true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:11.31" dur="00:00:05.00">If x is false and y is true, the<br/>entire or expression is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:16.31" dur="00:00:02.58">And if x is false<br/>and y is false,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:18.89" dur="00:00:05.05">then and only then is the<br/>expression x or y false.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:23.94" dur="00:00:05.39">If you want to think of trues<br/>and falses as 0 and non-0 value,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:29.33" dur="00:00:03.62">then you can think of x<br/>and y being true as 1s.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:32.95" dur="00:00:03.35">The OR operator works like<br/>addition, so when you add 1</p>
    <p begin="00:03:36.30" dur="00:00:04.42">and 1 you get a non-0<br/>value, which is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.72" dur="00:00:02.55">When you add a true and a false,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:43.27" dur="00:00:03.32">you get a non-0 value,<br/>which is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:46.59" dur="00:00:05.34">And a false and a true add<br/>up to 1 not 0, so it's true.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:51.93" dur="00:00:01.54">Only when both parts of an</p>
    <p begin="00:03:53.47" dur="00:00:03.26">OR expression are false<br/>does the addition result</p>
    <p begin="00:03:56.73" dur="00:00:02.60">in 0, which is also false.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:59.33" dur="00:00:03.35">So in short, with<br/>an OR operator,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:02.68" dur="00:00:02.64">both parts of the<br/>expression have to be false</p>
    <p begin="00:04:05.32" dur="00:00:04.57">for the entire thing to be<br/>false, otherwise it's true.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:09.89" dur="00:00:02.92">You can combine AND<br/>and OR operators</p>
    <p begin="00:04:12.81" dur="00:00:02.65">into a single expression;<br/>for example,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:15.46" dur="00:00:04.78">if you have an expression<br/>that's true and false or true,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:20.24" dur="00:00:04.36">you can think of it<br/>as 1 times 0 plus 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:24.60" dur="00:00:04.27">You know from arithmetic<br/>precedence that 1 times 0 is 0,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:28.87" dur="00:00:02.08">and when you add 1, you get 1,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:30.95" dur="00:00:02.56">so the entire expression<br/>is true.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:33.51" dur="00:00:03.61">[ Pause ]</p>
    <p begin="00:04:37.12" dur="00:00:04.82">As another example, if you<br/>have false or false and true,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:41.94" dur="00:00:04.44">you can think of it<br/>as 0 plus 0 times 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:46.38" dur="00:00:02.00">Multiplication takes<br/>place first,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:48.38" dur="00:00:05.93">so the result is 0 plus 0, the<br/>answer is 0, which is false.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:54.31" dur="00:00:03.57">That's a deeper look at<br/>AND and OR expressions.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:57.88" dur="00:00:01.16">Thanks for watching.</p>
