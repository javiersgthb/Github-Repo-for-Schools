    <p begin="00:00:01.19" dur="00:00:02.08">This is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:03.27" dur="00:00:03.75">Let's talk about declaring<br/>variables and constants.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:07.02" dur="00:00:03.92">A variable is a named<br/>memory location.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:10.94" dur="00:00:02.27">If you couldn't provide<br/>reasonable names</p>
    <p begin="00:00:13.21" dur="00:00:02.09">for the memory locations<br/>in your programs,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.30" dur="00:00:02.68">you'd have to remember<br/>their memory addresses.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:17.98" dur="00:00:03.18">It's much more convenient<br/>to remember a name,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.16" dur="00:00:04.14">like myAge perhaps,<br/>where 27 is stored,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.30" dur="00:00:03.97">or myName perhaps<br/>where Wendy is stored.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:29.27" dur="00:00:02.06">These are different<br/>memory locations</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.33" dur="00:00:03.18">that have reasonable names.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.51" dur="00:00:04.04">When you declare a variable,<br/>you must provide a data type.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.55" dur="00:00:04.40">The two broadest data<br/>types are num and string.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.95" dur="00:00:03.76">Many programming languages have<br/>several other more specific data</p>
    <p begin="00:00:46.71" dur="00:00:03.00">types, but these two<br/>are the broadest types</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.71" dur="00:00:03.41">that hold numeric<br/>data and string data.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:53.12" dur="00:00:04.03">When you declare a variable, you<br/>must also provide an identifier.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:57.15" dur="00:00:03.29">An identifier is the name<br/>for the variable, which has</p>
    <p begin="00:01:00.44" dur="00:00:02.78">to be one word that<br/>starts with a letter</p>
    <p begin="00:01:03.22" dur="00:00:03.51">and not have any<br/>spaces embedded in it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:06.73" dur="00:00:03.51">When you declare a variable,<br/>you also have the option</p>
    <p begin="00:01:10.24" dur="00:00:02.51">of providing a starting value.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:12.75" dur="00:00:04.25">If you provide a starting value,<br/>it's called an initialization.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:03.60">The starting value<br/>is an initial value.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:20.60" dur="00:00:04.50">For example, you can declare a<br/>numeric variable called myAge</p>
    <p begin="00:01:25.10" dur="00:00:03.63">by giving it the data type<br/>num, calling it myAge,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:28.73" dur="00:00:02.96">and providing a starting<br/>value of 27.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:31.69" dur="00:00:05.13">You can declare another<br/>variable, numeric yourAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:36.82" dur="00:00:03.70">If you don't provide a<br/>starting value, that's OK,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:40.52" dur="00:00:01.97">but garbage is stored there.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:42.49" dur="00:00:04.25">Garbage is an unknown value<br/>that resides in a variable</p>
    <p begin="00:01:46.74" dur="00:00:03.57">that has not yet been<br/>assigned a value.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:50.31" dur="00:00:02.33">After you've declared variables,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:52.64" dur="00:00:02.37">you can change the<br/>value stored there</p>
    <p begin="00:01:55.01" dur="00:00:02.29">by assigning a new<br/>value to them.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:57.30" dur="00:00:06.17">For example, myAge equals<br/>37 assigns 37 to myAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:03.47" dur="00:00:03.64">And yourAge equals 19 puts a 19</p>
    <p begin="00:02:07.11" dur="00:00:03.65">where the garbage used<br/>to be in yourAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:12.12" dur="00:00:01.56">You can do arithmetic.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:13.68" dur="00:00:03.33">yourAge equals myAge minus 3.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:17.01" dur="00:00:05.99">That changes yourAge to<br/>3 less than 37, or 34.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:24.02" dur="00:00:02.88">You can declare a<br/>numeric variable, total,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:26.90" dur="00:00:01.51">without a starting value,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.41" dur="00:00:02.30">so garbage is stored there,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:30.71" dur="00:00:02.43">and then you can<br/>assign arithmetic to it.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:33.14" dur="00:00:02.56">total is myAge plus yourAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:35.70" dur="00:00:03.18">The addition is performed,<br/>and the total is stored</p>
    <p begin="00:02:38.88" dur="00:00:03.16">at the location named total.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:42.04" dur="00:00:02.50">You might declare another<br/>numeric variable named</p>
    <p begin="00:02:44.54" dur="00:00:01.08">total2.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:45.62" dur="00:00:03.49">With no initial value,<br/>garbage is stored there,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:49.11" dur="00:00:04.66">and you can declare a variable<br/>tomsAge with no initial value.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:53.77" dur="00:00:03.62">Garbage is stored there, and<br/>when you do the arithmetic,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:57.39" dur="00:00:03.64">total2 equals <br/>myAge plus tomsAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:01.03" dur="00:00:03.67">It's illegal because<br/>tomsAge has garbage and</p>
    <p begin="00:03:04.70" dur="00:00:04.97">cannot be added to myAge.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:09.67" dur="00:00:02.60">You might declare a<br/>string variable, myName,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:12.27" dur="00:00:02.90">and initialize it to Wendy.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:15.17" dur="00:00:03.37">You might declare another<br/>string variable, yourName,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:18.54" dur="00:00:05.01">and not assign any initial value<br/>and have garbage stored there.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:23.55" dur="00:00:02.50">You could assign a<br/>value to myName later</p>
    <p begin="00:03:26.05" dur="00:00:02.71">by storing Jake there.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:28.76" dur="00:00:02.53">You could assign a<br/>value to yourName later</p>
    <p begin="00:03:31.29" dur="00:00:03.28">by storing Alice there.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:34.57" dur="00:00:05.87">You could try to assign <br/>myAge to myName, but you can't.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.44" dur="00:00:01.43">It's illegal.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:41.87" dur="00:00:02.23">The data types have<br/>to be the same.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:44.10" dur="00:00:03.41">Only numeric values can be<br/>assigned to numeric variables.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:47.51" dur="00:00:05.30">Only string values can be<br/>assigned to string variables.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:52.81" dur="00:00:03.71">Declaring named constants<br/>means providing a name</p>
    <p begin="00:03:56.52" dur="00:00:03.76">for a memory location that<br/>is not intended to change.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:00.28" dur="00:00:03.62">By convention, most programmers<br/>use all uppercase letters</p>
    <p begin="00:04:03.90" dur="00:00:01.83">for their named constants,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:05.73" dur="00:00:03.12">and you can assign<br/>initial value there.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:08.85" dur="00:00:03.14">In many programming languages,<br/>you need an additional word, like</p>
    <p begin="00:04:11.99" dur="00:00:03.76">"constant" or "final", in<br/>front of the declaration.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:15.75" dur="00:00:03.78">Once a constant is declared<br/>and stored in memory,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:19.53" dur="00:00:04.97">you might attempt to change<br/>its value by making a statement</p>
    <p begin="00:04:24.50" dur="00:00:03.60">such as TAX_RATE equals 0.04.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:28.10" dur="00:00:01.59">That's illegal.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:29.69" dur="00:00:04.48">A constant is intended<br/>never to change.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:34.17" dur="00:00:04.23">That's an overview of<br/>variables and constants.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:39.45" dur="00:00:01.51">Thanks for watching.</p>
