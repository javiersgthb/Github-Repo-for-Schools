    This is Joyce Farrell. 

    Let's talk about declaring variables and constants. 

    A variable is a named memory location. 

    If you couldn't provide reasonable names 

    for the memory locations in your programs, 

    you'd have to remember their memory addresses. 

    It's much more convenient to remember a name, 

    like myAge perhaps, where 27 is stored, 

    or myName perhaps where Wendy is stored. 

    These are different memory locations 

    that have reasonable names. 

    When you declare a variable, you must provide a data type. 

    The two broadest data types are num and string. 

    Many programming languages have several other more specific data 

    types, but these two are the broadest types 

    that hold numeric data and string data. 

    When you declare a variable, you must also provide an identifier. 

    An identifier is the name for the variable, which has 

    to be one word that starts with a letter 

    and not have any spaces embedded in it. 

    When you declare a variable, you also have the option 

    of providing a starting value. 

    If you provide a starting value, it's called an initialization. 

    The starting value is an initial value. 

    For example, you can declare a numeric variable called myAge 

    by giving it the data type num, calling it myAge, 

    and providing a starting value of 27. 

    You can declare another variable, numeric yourAge. 

    If you don't provide a starting value, that's OK, 

    but garbage is stored there. 

    Garbage is an unknown value that resides in a variable 

    that has not yet been assigned a value. 

    After you've declared variables, 

    you can change the value stored there 

    by assigning a new value to them. 

    For example, myAge equals 37 assigns 37 to myAge. 

    And yourAge equals 19 puts a 19 

    where the garbage used to be in yourAge. 

    You can do arithmetic. 

    yourAge equals myAge minus 3. 

    That changes yourAge to 3 less than 37, or 34. 

    You can declare a numeric variable, total, 

    without a starting value, 

    so garbage is stored there, 

    and then you can assign arithmetic to it. 

    total is myAge plus yourAge. 

    The addition is performed, and the total is stored 

    at the location named total. 

    You might declare another numeric variable named 

    total2. 

    With no initial value, garbage is stored there, 

    and you can declare a variable tomsAge with no initial value. 

    Garbage is stored there, and when you do the arithmetic, 

    total2 equals  myAge plus tomsAge. 

    It's illegal because tomsAge has garbage and 

    cannot be added to myAge. 

    You might declare a string variable, myName, 

    and initialize it to Wendy. 

    You might declare another string variable, yourName, 

    and not assign any initial value and have garbage stored there. 

    You could assign a value to myName later 

    by storing Jake there. 

    You could assign a value to yourName later 

    by storing Alice there. 

    You could try to assign  myAge to myName, but you can't. 

    It's illegal. 

    The data types have to be the same. 

    Only numeric values can be assigned to numeric variables. 

    Only string values can be assigned to string variables. 

    Declaring named constants means providing a name 

    for a memory location that is not intended to change. 

    By convention, most programmers use all uppercase letters 

    for their named constants, 

    and you can assign initial value there. 

    In many programming languages, you need an additional word, like 

    &quot;constant&quot; or &quot;final&quot;, in front of the declaration. 

    Once a constant is declared and stored in memory, 

    you might attempt to change its value by making a statement 

    such as TAX_RATE equals 0.04. 

    That's illegal. 

    A constant is intended never to change. 

    That's an overview of variables and constants. 

    Thanks for watching.
