    <p begin="00:00:00.88" dur="00:00:01.49">&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.37" dur="00:00:03.65">I want to talk about<br/>using parallel arrays.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:06.02" dur="00:00:02.04">What are parallel arrays?</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.06" dur="00:00:04.18">Well, parallel arrays occur<br/>when you have two or more arrays</p>
    <p begin="00:00:12.24" dur="00:00:04.47">in memory, and they're parallel<br/>when the data in each element</p>
    <p begin="00:00:16.71" dur="00:00:03.36">of one array logically<br/>corresponds to the data</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.07" dur="00:00:04.22">in the same relative<br/>position in the second array.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:24.29" dur="00:00:03.07">For example, suppose<br/>you have four employees</p>
    <p begin="00:00:27.36" dur="00:00:03.44">with different ID numbers, and<br/>different names, and you want</p>
    <p begin="00:00:30.80" dur="00:00:01.59">to be able to write a program</p>
    <p begin="00:00:32.39" dur="00:00:02.62">where a user can<br/>input the ID number</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.01" dur="00:00:02.65">and output the correct name.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:37.66" dur="00:00:04.29">You would start by declaring an<br/>array of ID numbers as follows:</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.95" dur="00:00:03.61">numeric ID number -- four of<br/>them -- and then list them.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:45.56" dur="00:00:04.07">In memory, the ID numbers<br/>would look like this.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.63" dur="00:00:02.73">Then you declare<br/>an array of names.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.36" dur="00:00:02.91">And in memory, they'd<br/>look like this.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.27" dur="00:00:02.22">You'd need a few<br/>other variables.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:57.49" dur="00:00:03.51">A numeric subscript used to<br/>cycle through the array looking</p>
    <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:03.11">for the correct ID<br/>number, a user entry</p>
    <p begin="00:01:04.11" dur="00:00:02.11">where the user will<br/>type in the ID number</p>
    <p begin="00:01:06.22" dur="00:00:03.06">that we're looking<br/>for, and a found name,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:09.28" dur="00:00:03.18">where we're going to store the<br/>correct name when we find it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:12.46" dur="00:00:03.84">For right now, it's going<br/>to say, "not found."</p>
    <p begin="00:01:16.30" dur="00:00:03.80">When you start the program,<br/>the subscript is set to zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:20.10" dur="00:00:02.23">Then you input the user's entry.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:22.33" dur="00:00:03.66">Let's assume the<br/>user types in 172.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:25.99" dur="00:00:03.24">You compare the subscript<br/>to four</p>
    <p begin="00:01:29.23" dur="00:00:02.92">to make sure you've not gone<br/>past the end of the array,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:32.15" dur="00:00:03.44">and the subscript is zero,<br/>so it is less than four,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:35.59" dur="00:00:04.84">and then you compare the user's<br/>entry, 172, with the ID number</p>
    <p begin="00:01:40.43" dur="00:00:03.80">at position zero, which is 121.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:44.23" dur="00:00:03.11">They're not equal, so we'll<br/>end the if statement and wait</p>
    <p begin="00:01:47.34" dur="00:00:03.56">until later to show what<br/>we do when they are equal.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:50.90" dur="00:00:04.13">Then add one to the subscript, so<br/>it's one, and you reach the end</p>
    <p begin="00:01:55.03" dur="00:00:02.16">of the body of the loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:57.19" dur="00:00:03.30">You return to the top and<br/>compare the subscript to four.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.49" dur="00:00:04.68">It's less, so you compare<br/>the user's entry, 172,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:05.17" dur="00:00:04.25">with the ID number in<br/>position one, which is 135.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:09.42" dur="00:00:03.12">They're not equal, so<br/>the if statement ends,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:12.54" dur="00:00:01.79">and you add one more to sub.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:14.33" dur="00:00:02.28">So, sub is now two.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:16.61" dur="00:00:03.18">The loop is at the end, and<br/>you compare the subscript</p>
    <p begin="00:02:19.79" dur="00:00:01.42">to four again.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:21.21" dur="00:00:03.78">You're still within range,<br/>so the loop continues.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:24.99" dur="00:00:04.79">When you compare the user<br/>entry, 172, with ID number two,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:29.78" dur="00:00:02.01">this time they're equal.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:31.79" dur="00:00:03.88">So, in the foundName<br/>you store the name</p>
    <p begin="00:02:35.67" dur="00:00:02.84">at position two in<br/>the name array.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:38.51" dur="00:00:03.59">The arrays are parallel because<br/>the ID number at position two</p>
    <p begin="00:02:42.10" dur="00:00:02.81">in one array corresponds<br/>to the name</p>
    <p begin="00:02:44.91" dur="00:00:03.27">and position two<br/>in the other array.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:48.18" dur="00:00:04.12">Then you end the if statement,<br/>add one to the subscript,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:52.30" dur="00:00:04.03">reach the bottom of the loop,<br/>compare the subscript to four.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:56.33" dur="00:00:05.85">It is still less, so<br/>you compare 189 and 172.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:02.18" dur="00:00:02.94">They're not equal, so<br/>the if statement ends.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:05.12" dur="00:00:02.23">You increase the subscript.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:07.35" dur="00:00:03.53">It's the end of the<br/>while loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:10.88" dur="00:00:04.46">Now when you compare sub to<br/>four, it's not less than four,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:15.34" dur="00:00:02.13">so the loop is over.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:17.47" dur="00:00:04.42">You continue then to output<br/>the ID number, the user entry,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:21.89" dur="00:00:03.57">which is 172, and the<br/>found name that goes</p>
    <p begin="00:03:25.46" dur="00:00:02.75">with the user entry, Carl.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:28.21" dur="00:00:03.05">You've successfully<br/>found the right name</p>
    <p begin="00:03:31.26" dur="00:00:02.80">with the ID number<br/>that was entered.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:34.06" dur="00:00:04.83">Now, if the array had had 100<br/>elements instead of only four,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:38.89" dur="00:00:03.08">the loop would have<br/>continued for a long while</p>
    <p begin="00:03:41.97" dur="00:00:03.45">after you found ID number 172.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:45.42" dur="00:00:03.46">You can make the loop a little<br/>more efficient by exiting</p>
    <p begin="00:03:48.88" dur="00:00:02.61">as soon as you find<br/>the correct name,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:51.49" dur="00:00:02.68">so let's start over.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:54.17" dur="00:00:03.57">Let's make the loop efficient by<br/>changing the while statement</p>
    <p begin="00:03:57.74" dur="00:00:04.77">to not only to compare the sub<br/>to four, but also to compare the</p>
    <p begin="00:04:02.51" dur="00:00:02.55">found name to not found.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:05.06" dur="00:00:04.91">While it still says "not<br/>found," you want to keep going.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:09.97" dur="00:00:02.75">Let's wipe everything<br/>out and start over.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:12.72" dur="00:00:02.42">Wipe out the subscript<br/>and the user entry,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:15.14" dur="00:00:03.33">and set foundName<br/>back to "not found."</p>
    <p begin="00:04:18.47" dur="00:00:03.63">This time when the code<br/>starts, you can set sub to zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:22.10" dur="00:00:04.59">Let's say the user enters<br/>121. Compare sub to four,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:26.69" dur="00:00:01.29">it is less than four,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:27.98" dur="00:00:02.33">and compare foundName to not found.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:30.31" dur="00:00:03.37">It is not found,<br/>so enter the loop</p>
    <p begin="00:04:33.68" dur="00:00:03.87">and compare the user<br/>entry to ID number zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:37.55" dur="00:00:05.30">121 is 121, so you<br/>can take foundName</p>
    <p begin="00:04:42.85" dur="00:00:02.11">and set it to name[0]</p>
    <p begin="00:04:44.96" dur="00:00:02.70">foundName becomes Ann.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:47.66" dur="00:00:04.89">That's the end of the if<br/>statement, and sub becomes one.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:52.55" dur="00:00:03.23">That's the end of the loop,<br/>so you go back to the top.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:55.78" dur="00:00:05.14">sub is less than four, but<br/>foundName is not "not found."</p>
    <p begin="00:05:00.92" dur="00:00:02.61">foundName is now Ann,</p>
    <p begin="00:05:03.53" dur="00:00:02.04">so the while loop is over.</p>
    <p begin="00:05:05.57" dur="00:00:03.56">It's not going to<br/>execute anymore.</p>
    <p begin="00:05:09.13" dur="00:00:05.87">You can output the ID number,<br/>121, and the foundName, Ann,</p>
    <p begin="00:05:15.00" dur="00:00:02.27">by getting out of<br/>the loop early when</p>
    <p begin="00:05:17.27" dur="00:00:02.81">foundName no longer<br/>was "not found."</p>
    <p begin="00:05:20.08" dur="00:00:02.43">You saved a lot of time.</p>
    <p begin="00:05:22.51" dur="00:00:04.00">[ Silence ]</p>
    <p begin="00:05:26.51" dur="00:00:01.15">Thanks for watching.</p>
