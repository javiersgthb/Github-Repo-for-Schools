    <p begin="00:00:00.65" dur="00:00:01.81">&gt;&gt; Joyce: Hi, this<br/>is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.46" dur="00:00:04.40">Let's take a first look at<br/>a simple computer program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:06.86" dur="00:00:02.38">Some basic programming<br/>operations occur</p>
    <p begin="00:00:09.24" dur="00:00:02.60">in almost every computer<br/>program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.84" dur="00:00:04.98">First there's input, a user<br/>puts some data into a program,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:16.82" dur="00:00:01.80">some facts and figures.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:18.62" dur="00:00:03.75">Input devices that are used<br/>include keyboards and mice.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.37" dur="00:00:02.56">Sometimes input data<br/>comes on a disk.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:24.93" dur="00:00:02.64">Audio data might come<br/>through a microphone.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:27.57" dur="00:00:03.22">After the data is<br/>input, it's processed.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:30.79" dur="00:00:00.96">The piece of hardware</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.75" dur="00:00:03.22">that performs processing is<br/>the Central Processing Unit</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.97" dur="00:00:01.65">or the CPU.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:36.62" dur="00:00:02.46">Processing might include<br/>doing some arithmetic</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.08" dur="00:00:03.70">or sorting the data or<br/>organizing it in some way.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.78" dur="00:00:01.36">After data is input</p>
    <p begin="00:00:44.14" dur="00:00:04.31">and processed, you can output the<br/>information that you've created.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:48.45" dur="00:00:02.76">Output is available<br/>for a user to see,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:51.21" dur="00:00:02.57">to see the results<br/>of the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:53.78" dur="00:00:03.30">Output devices include<br/>monitors and printers.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:57.08" dur="00:00:02.73">Audio output might<br/>come through speakers</p>
    <p begin="00:00:59.81" dur="00:00:02.58">or sometimes output is<br/>sent to a disk and then</p>
    <p begin="00:01:02.39" dur="00:00:04.55">that disk might be used as<br/>input into a new program.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:06.94" dur="00:00:01.64">When programmers plan the logic</p>
    <p begin="00:01:08.58" dur="00:00:03.11">for their programs they<br/>tend to use 1 of 2 tools.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:11.69" dur="00:00:02.39">Flowcharts are pictorial<br/>representations</p>
    <p begin="00:01:14.08" dur="00:00:02.13">of the logical steps<br/>in a program</p>
    <p begin="00:01:16.21" dur="00:00:02.01">and pseudocode is<br/>the logical steps</p>
    <p begin="00:01:18.22" dur="00:00:03.67">of a program written<br/>out in English form.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:21.89" dur="00:00:02.67">Here's the logic for<br/>a program that adds 1</p>
    <p begin="00:01:24.56" dur="00:00:02.04">to a user's input number.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:26.60" dur="00:00:02.64">On the left is the<br/>flowchart of the program,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:29.24" dur="00:00:02.20">on the top right<br/>is the pseudocode</p>
    <p begin="00:01:31.44" dur="00:00:02.61">and on the bottom right is<br/>what the program might look</p>
    <p begin="00:01:34.05" dur="00:00:02.33">like after it's been<br/>written and it's running</p>
    <p begin="00:01:36.38" dur="00:00:02.50">in a Command Prompt window.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:38.88" dur="00:00:04.19">In both the flowchart and pseudocode,<br/> the first step is to start.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:43.07" dur="00:00:03.22">In the Command Prompt window,<br/>you might type a command</p>
    <p begin="00:01:46.29" dur="00:00:01.62">to run the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:47.91" dur="00:00:02.61">The command will differ in<br/>every programming language</p>
    <p begin="00:01:50.52" dur="00:00:01.13">that you use.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:51.65" dur="00:00:02.49">This program happens to<br/>have been written in Java,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:54.14" dur="00:00:03.21">so the command is Java<br/>and then OneMore,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:57.35" dur="00:00:02.89">which is the name<br/>of the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.24" dur="00:00:03.02">In both the flowchart and the<br/>pseudocode the next step is</p>
    <p begin="00:02:03.26" dur="00:00:02.73">to input the user's entry.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:05.99" dur="00:00:04.27">In a real program, you might add<br/>an output statement before input</p>
    <p begin="00:02:10.26" dur="00:00:03.12">usersEntry to explain<br/>to the user what to do.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:13.38" dur="00:00:02.06">In this very simple example,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:15.44" dur="00:00:03.28">on the output screen, we'll just<br/>have a question mark asking the</p>
    <p begin="00:02:18.72" dur="00:00:02.92">user for an entry, and<br/>then the user types</p>
    <p begin="00:02:21.64" dur="00:00:04.24">in some data, let's say 16.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:25.88" dur="00:00:01.92">The next step in<br/>both the flowchart</p>
    <p begin="00:02:27.80" dur="00:00:04.20">and the pseudocode sets a<br/>spot in memory, called Result,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:32.00" dur="00:00:02.54">to usersEntry + 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:34.54" dur="00:00:02.46">Nothing happens on the<br/>screen during this step.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:37.00" dur="00:00:03.42">This processing happens in<br/>the central processing unit</p>
    <p begin="00:02:40.42" dur="00:00:05.33">and in memory, so result becomes<br/>one more than the user's entry.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:45.75" dur="00:00:04.92">The next step in both the<br/>flowchart and the pseudocode is</p>
    <p begin="00:02:50.67" dur="00:00:03.24">to output the words<br/>"One more than", followed</p>
    <p begin="00:02:53.91" dur="00:00:02.42">by the usersEntry, followed</p>
    <p begin="00:02:56.33" dur="00:00:03.80">by the word "is", and<br/>ending in result.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:00.13" dur="00:00:04.73">On the screen it says,<br/>"One more than 16 is 17"</p>
    <p begin="00:03:04.86" dur="00:00:03.05">because 17 is the<br/>value of result,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:07.91" dur="00:00:03.50">and then the program ends.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:11.41" dur="00:00:03.79">You can run the program again,<br/>start it, give the command</p>
    <p begin="00:03:15.20" dur="00:00:06.43">to start it, ask for input,<br/>perhaps the user types 345.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:21.63" dur="00:00:03.86">In memory, result is set to 346,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:25.49" dur="00:00:03.17">but you don't see anything<br/>happen on the screen yet.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:28.66" dur="00:00:02.07">When both the flowchart<br/>and the pseudocode get</p>
    <p begin="00:03:30.73" dur="00:00:03.51">to the output statement,<br/>then on the screen you see,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:34.24" dur="00:00:04.75">"One more than 345 is 346,"</p>
    <p begin="00:03:38.99" dur="00:00:03.98">and both the flowchart<br/>and pseudocode stop.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:42.97" dur="00:00:03.88">You don't have to run programs<br/>in a command line environment.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:46.85" dur="00:00:01.74">Some programs are created to run</p>
    <p begin="00:03:48.59" dur="00:00:01.70">in a GUI <br/>environment.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:50.29" dur="00:00:03.45">GUI means Graphical<br/>User Interface.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:53.74" dur="00:00:03.38">For example, suppose you have<br/>the GUI screen that you see</p>
    <p begin="00:03:57.12" dur="00:00:02.44">in the lower-right<br/>part of the screen.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:59.56" dur="00:00:02.67">In the flowchart and the<br/>pseudocode, you still start</p>
    <p begin="00:04:02.23" dur="00:00:01.35">the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:03.58" dur="00:00:02.22">You still input the<br/>user's entry.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:05.80" dur="00:00:04.26">Let's say the user<br/>types 67 into a textbox.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:10.06" dur="00:00:04.11">In memory, the result becomes<br/>usersEntry + 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:14.17" dur="00:00:03.19">You don't see anything<br/>happen on the screen.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:17.36" dur="00:00:03.29">In both the flowchart and the<br/>pseudocode, the next step is</p>
    <p begin="00:04:20.65" dur="00:00:05.12">to output one more than<br/>user's entry is result.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:25.77" dur="00:00:05.85">And on the GUI screen you can<br/>see One more than 67 is 68.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:31.62" dur="00:00:01.94">The flowchart and pseudocode</p>
    <p begin="00:04:33.56" dur="00:00:03.78">for the GUI program are<br/>identical to what they were</p>
    <p begin="00:04:37.34" dur="00:00:01.98">for the command line program.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:39.32" dur="00:00:04.39">The logic is the same no<br/>matter what the environment is.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:43.71" dur="00:00:01.26">Thanks for watching.</p>
