 Let's talk about arrays. 

    An array is a list of continuous values stored 

    in computer memory. 

    Every array has a specified size. 

    Every array is made up of a number of items called elements. 

    Each element in an array must have the same data type. 

    And every element can be accessed using a subscript. 

    A subscript is a whole number value ranging from zero 

    to one less than the size of the array. 

    For example, if you want 

    to declare a four-element numeric array, you give it a data type, 

    num, and a name like money, 

    and then you indicate the size of the array. 

    In this case, it's a four-element array, 

    so four memory locations are reserved. 

    The names of those locations are money[0], 

    money[1], money[2], and money[3]. 

    The subscripts appearing within the square brackets range 

    from zero to one less than the size of the array. 

    You can assign a value to an array element. 

    For example, perhaps you want to say money[0] equals 14. 

    That assigns 14 to element zero of the array. 

    You don't have to assign values in order. 

    The next statement you make might be money[3] equals 82, 

    and that would assign an 82 to the last element 

    of this array, money[3]. 

    You then might say money[1] equals 6. 

    Or you might change a value at an element in the array 

    and say money[0] equals 9 and change its value. 

    You can perform arithmetic; 

    money[0] plus 10 is assigned to money[3]. 

    So now money[3] has the value 19. 

    What happens if you try to assign money[2] to money[1]? 

    In this case, it's illegal, 

    because money[2] has not been initialized, 

    so it has garbage value and cannot be assigned. 

    How about if you try to assign 20 to money[4]? 

    In this case, because it's a four-element array, 

    that statement is not valid, because there is no element 4. 

    A four-element array only has spots 0, 1, 2, and 3. 

    You can initialize an array when you declare it, 

    by giving it values to start. 

    For example, if you want all zeros, you might make a statement 

    like num money[4] equals and then list the zeros. 

    You can use a loop with an array, 

    which is often the most efficient way 

    to handle an array. 

    For example, suppose you declare a numeric variable named x, 

    and assign it zero. 

    Then you could start a loop, while x is less than 4. 

    Well, it is because it's zero. 

    You could assign money[x], which is money[0], the value zero. 

    That stores as zero at the spot money[0]. 

    Then you add 1 to x making it 1, 

    and reach the end of the loop body. 

    When you go to the top of the loop and check 

    to see whether x is less than 4, it is, because it's 1, 

    so you enter the loop and assign it a zero 

    to money[x], which is money[1]. 

    Then you add 1 to x making it 2, and reach the end 

    of the loop body and check again. 

    And since 2 is less than 4, you enter the loop body again. 

    You can assign a zero to money[2]; add 1 to x making it 3, 

    reach the end of the loop body. 

    3 is less than 4, so you assign a zero to spot money[3]. 

    Then x becomes 4, and you reached the end 

    of the loop body. 

    Now when you check if x is less than 4, it's not less 

    than 4, because it is 4. 

    So, the loop ends, and you have successfully assigned zero 

    to each array element. 

    Thanks for watching.
