    <p begin="00:00:00.55" dur="00:00:02.99">&gt;&gt; Hi, this is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:03.54" dur="00:00:04.56">Let's discuss how to<br/>accumulate values in an array.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.10" dur="00:00:02.41">Suppose you want to<br/>create a dependents report</p>
    <p begin="00:00:10.51" dur="00:00:01.63">that looks like this.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:12.14" dur="00:00:03.09">It has headings,<br/>dependents and count,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:15.23" dur="00:00:03.64">and then down the left-hand<br/>column it lists 0, 1, 2, 3,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:18.87" dur="00:00:03.85">4, and 5 dependents, and in<br/>the right-hand column a count</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.72" dur="00:00:03.68">of how many employees have<br/>each number of dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:26.40" dur="00:00:05.51">For example, assume 43 of your<br/>employees have zero dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.91" dur="00:00:02.13">Here's the logic<br/>for the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.04" dur="00:00:02.63">It starts and you<br/>declare the variables</p>
    <p begin="00:00:36.67" dur="00:00:01.91">and constants you'll need.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.58" dur="00:00:01.68">You need dep,<br/>that's</p>
    <p begin="00:00:40.26" dur="00:00:02.63">where the user will<br/>enter the number</p>
    <p begin="00:00:42.89" dur="00:00:03.44">of dependents the<br/>given employee has.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:46.33" dur="00:00:04.08">You'll also create a<br/>six-element array called count,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:50.41" dur="00:00:03.49">and each element<br/>will be set to zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:53.90" dur="00:00:04.34">QUIT is a constant equal to 999.<br/>That's what the user will enter</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.24" dur="00:00:04.44">when there are no more<br/>employee values to be entered.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:02.68" dur="00:00:04.25">You'll output enter<br/>dependents or 999 to quit</p>
    <p begin="00:01:06.93" dur="00:00:03.38">to prompt the user for the<br/>first number of dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:10.31" dur="00:00:06.77">Assume the first employee has 3<br/>dependents, so you'll input a 3.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:17.08" dur="00:00:06.79">This value is not equal to<br/>999, so you add 1 to the count</p>
    <p begin="00:01:23.87" dur="00:00:03.02">that corresponds to the<br/>number of dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:26.89" dur="00:00:02.82">In other words, since<br/>dep is 3,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:29.71" dur="00:00:04.39">you take count[3]<br/>and add 1 to it.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:34.10" dur="00:00:02.77">Then you prompt the user<br/>to enter the next number</p>
    <p begin="00:01:36.87" dur="00:00:03.86">of dependents or quit<br/>if it's time to quit.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:40.73" dur="00:00:06.14">And let's just assume the next<br/>employee also has 3 dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:46.87" dur="00:00:05.28">This value is not 999, so<br/>you add another 1 to count[3].</p>
    <p begin="00:01:52.15" dur="00:00:02.50">count[3]is now 2.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:54.65" dur="00:00:04.28">Prompt the user again and assume<br/>the next employee record has</p>
    <p begin="00:01:58.93" dur="00:00:02.03">zero dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.96" dur="00:00:04.27">This isn't the quit value,<br/>so now you take count[0]</p>
    <p begin="00:02:05.23" dur="00:00:02.87">and add 1 to it because<br/>the number of dependents</p>
    <p begin="00:02:08.10" dur="00:00:02.81">for this employee is zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:10.91" dur="00:00:01.92">Prompt the user again,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:12.83" dur="00:00:03.38">and assume the next<br/>input value is 5.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:16.21" dur="00:00:05.28">This is not the quit value,<br/>so you add 1 to count[5].</p>
    <p begin="00:02:21.49" dur="00:00:03.92">Prompt the user again and let's<br/>just say the next employee</p>
    <p begin="00:02:25.41" dur="00:00:03.34">record also has zero dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.75" dur="00:00:04.88">This is not the quit value, so<br/>you add another 1 to count[0].</p>
    <p begin="00:02:33.63" dur="00:00:02.25">count[0] is now 2.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:35.88" dur="00:00:01.99">At this point count[1], count[2],</p>
    <p begin="00:02:37.87" dur="00:00:03.27">and count[4] haven't had<br/>anything added to them yet,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:41.14" dur="00:00:04.89">but count[0] is 2, count[3]<br/>is 2, and count[5] is 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:46.03" dur="00:00:02.44">Prompt the user again,<br/>and this time</p>
    <p begin="00:02:48.47" dur="00:00:03.31">when you input the user's<br/>dependents lets just say the</p>
    <p begin="00:02:51.78" dur="00:00:02.26">value is 999.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:54.04" dur="00:00:02.54">The user is ready to quit.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:56.58" dur="00:00:05.51">The value is quit, so you<br/>proceed to the finishUp module.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:02.09" dur="00:00:02.21">When the finishUp<br/>module starts,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:04.30" dur="00:00:04.49">you can output dependents and<br/>count at the top of the paper.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:08.79" dur="00:00:01.69">Then set dep to zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:10.48" dur="00:00:02.84">You're going to use dep<br/>as a subscript to walk</p>
    <p begin="00:03:13.32" dur="00:00:03.51">through the array and<br/>display each value.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:16.83" dur="00:00:05.92">dep is less than 6, so you<br/>output dep, which is zero,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:22.75" dur="00:00:02.34">and count[dep], which is 2.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:25.09" dur="00:00:04.91">So zero dependents, there were<br/>2 employees who had that number.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:30.00" dur="00:00:03.26">Then you add 1 to<br/>dep, so dep is now 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:33.26" dur="00:00:03.89">It's still less than<br/>6, so you output 1</p>
    <p begin="00:03:37.15" dur="00:00:02.93">and count[1], which is zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.08" dur="00:00:05.40">dep becomes 2. It's less than<br/>6, so you output the next row,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:45.48" dur="00:00:03.77">which is 2 dependents,<br/>count[0].</p>
    <p begin="00:03:49.25" dur="00:00:02.93">Add 1 to dep, it's now 3.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:52.18" dur="00:00:05.37">It's less than 6, so you output<br/>3 and the value of count[3],</p>
    <p begin="00:03:57.55" dur="00:00:02.96">which was 2 employees.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:00.51" dur="00:00:02.64">Add another 1 to<br/>dep. It's now 4.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:03.15" dur="00:00:04.42">It's less than 6, so you<br/>output a 4 and count[4],</p>
    <p begin="00:04:07.57" dur="00:00:02.28">the value of which is zero.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:09.85" dur="00:00:05.13">dep becomes 5. It's still<br/>less than 6, so you output a 5</p>
    <p begin="00:04:14.98" dur="00:00:03.15">and count[5], which<br/>is valued at 1.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:18.13" dur="00:00:04.38">dep becomes 6. Now it's not<br/>less than 6, and you're ready</p>
    <p begin="00:04:22.51" dur="00:00:04.00">to end this module<br/>and end the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:26.51" dur="00:00:03.73">You've successfully used an<br/>array to accumulate the number</p>
    <p begin="00:04:30.24" dur="00:00:04.88">of dependents for 0<br/>through 5 dependents.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:36.17" dur="00:00:00.98">Thanks for watching.</p>
