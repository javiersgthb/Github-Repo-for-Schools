    <p begin="00:00:00.72" dur="00:00:01.76">&gt;&gt; Joyce: Hi, this<br/>is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.48" dur="00:00:04.10">Let's continue to talk about<br/>the program development cycle.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:06.58" dur="00:00:02.55">In the last video you<br/>learned the first step</p>
    <p begin="00:00:09.13" dur="00:00:03.92">to developing a computer program<br/>is to understand the problem.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:13.05" dur="00:00:03.45">And we talked about the problem<br/>of being able to write a program</p>
    <p begin="00:00:16.50" dur="00:00:02.21">where you have a<br/>user type in a value,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:18.71" dur="00:00:02.29">the program doubles<br/>the value for the user,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:01.76">and outputs the answer.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:22.76" dur="00:00:03.29">We then talked about planning<br/>the logic to that problem,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:26.05" dur="00:00:02.23">and we used 2 tools: a flowchart</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.28" dur="00:00:02.97">and a pseudocode<br/>to show the logic.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:31.25" dur="00:00:03.24">The flowchart and the pseudocode<br/>look very similar. Both</p>
    <p begin="00:00:34.49" dur="00:00:04.74">start. Both allow a user to<br/>input a value called myNumber.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:39.23" dur="00:00:03.95">In both cases you set myAnswer<br/>equal to myNumber times 2</p>
    <p begin="00:00:43.18" dur="00:00:04.23">and then you output <br/>myAnswer and stop the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:47.41" dur="00:00:01.85">After you understand the problem</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.26" dur="00:00:02.26">and plan its logic,<br/>you can write the code</p>
    <p begin="00:00:51.52" dur="00:00:01.81">to the computer program.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:53.33" dur="00:00:01.58">Writing the code<br/>means putting it</p>
    <p begin="00:00:54.91" dur="00:00:03.47">into a computer programming<br/>language such as Visual Basic</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.38" dur="00:00:02.68">or C++ or Java.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:01.06" dur="00:00:02.67">For example, here's<br/>some Java code.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:03.73" dur="00:00:02.75">It looks confusing at<br/>first because there's dots</p>
    <p begin="00:01:06.48" dur="00:00:02.21">and parentheses and semicolons,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:08.69" dur="00:00:04.06">but basically what these 3<br/>statements do is get a value</p>
    <p begin="00:01:12.75" dur="00:00:03.94">from the keyboard and<br/>store it in myNumber.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:16.69" dur="00:00:03.02">The middle statement computes<br/>the value of myAnswer</p>
    <p begin="00:01:19.71" dur="00:00:02.52">as myNumber times 2.<br/>This one looks the most</p>
    <p begin="00:01:22.23" dur="00:00:02.84">like the flowchart or the<br/>pseudocode statement.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:25.07" dur="00:00:03.72">And then the last statement has<br/>some new words and some dots,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:28.79" dur="00:00:02.85">but it outputs the<br/>words Answer is</p>
    <p begin="00:01:31.64" dur="00:00:02.72">and then the value of myAnswer.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:34.36" dur="00:00:02.79">Notice that each Java<br/>statement ends in a semicolon</p>
    <p begin="00:01:37.15" dur="00:00:01.63">because that's required in Java.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:38.78" dur="00:00:03.19">It's not required in pseudocode<br/>or in a flowchart,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:41.97" dur="00:00:02.76">but Java has particular syntax<br/>that you have</p>
    <p begin="00:01:44.73" dur="00:00:03.93">to learn before you can<br/>write this program in Java.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:48.66" dur="00:00:03.31">In most computer programs,<br/>you would add a prompt</p>
    <p begin="00:01:51.97" dur="00:00:03.75">for the user before the input<br/>statement. This one displays</p>
    <p begin="00:01:55.72" dur="00:00:02.21">on the screen Enter a number</p>
    <p begin="00:01:57.93" dur="00:00:02.28">and then shows 2 little<br/>right-facing arrows</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.21" dur="00:00:02.61">to show the user where<br/>to type in an answer.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:02.82" dur="00:00:04.88">A complete Java program would<br/>have many more statements in it.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:07.70" dur="00:00:02.52">You can see some statements<br/>before the core part</p>
    <p begin="00:02:10.22" dur="00:00:03.19">of this program and<br/>some punctuation after,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:13.41" dur="00:00:02.48">but the highlighted<br/>part of the screen shows</p>
    <p begin="00:02:15.89" dur="00:00:03.04">that you prompt the<br/>user to enter a number,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:18.93" dur="00:00:02.76">you get the number,<br/>you compute myAnswer,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:21.69" dur="00:00:03.86">and you output the<br/>value of myAnswer.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:25.55" dur="00:00:02.14">Here's the Java <br/>NumberDoubling program</p>
    <p begin="00:02:27.69" dur="00:00:03.20">with a mistake purposely<br/>entered into it.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:30.89" dur="00:00:01.10">Because you're not familiar</p>
    <p begin="00:02:31.99" dur="00:00:03.44">with Java, you might not notice<br/>the mistake right away, but it's</p>
    <p begin="00:02:35.43" dur="00:00:03.70">in the last line of code<br/>that displays myAnswer.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:39.13" dur="00:00:03.98">I've purposely left off the<br/>semicolon that Java requires</p>
    <p begin="00:02:43.11" dur="00:00:01.95">at the end of every statement.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:45.06" dur="00:00:01.71">I've purposely made this mistake</p>
    <p begin="00:02:46.77" dur="00:00:02.52">because when you type a<br/>program it is very easy</p>
    <p begin="00:02:49.29" dur="00:00:02.30">to make a typographical<br/>error, and I want</p>
    <p begin="00:02:51.59" dur="00:00:03.30">to show you what happens<br/>when you make one.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:54.89" dur="00:00:02.79">After you understand a<br/>problem, plan its logic,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:57.68" dur="00:00:03.33">and write the code you're<br/>ready to translate the code.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:01.01" dur="00:00:02.22">Translating the code<br/>means using a piece</p>
    <p begin="00:03:03.23" dur="00:00:03.15">of software, called a<br/>compiler or an interpreter,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:06.38" dur="00:00:02.97">and taking your code in<br/>the programming language</p>
    <p begin="00:03:09.35" dur="00:00:03.12">and turning it into machine<br/>language, which is the 1</p>
    <p begin="00:03:12.47" dur="00:00:03.80">and 0 circuitry language<br/>inside the computer.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:16.27" dur="00:00:03.93">For example, one way to<br/>compile a Java program is to go</p>
    <p begin="00:03:20.20" dur="00:00:03.21">to the Command Prompt and<br/>type javac, which stands</p>
    <p begin="00:03:23.41" dur="00:00:04.25">for Java Compile, and type<br/>the name of the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:27.66" dur="00:00:04.18">When you press the Enter key,<br/>in this case, you get a mistake.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:31.84" dur="00:00:03.79">It says NumberDoubling.java12<br/>because the mistake happens</p>
    <p begin="00:03:35.63" dur="00:00:02.04">to be in line 12 of the program,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:37.67" dur="00:00:02.97">and then it says<br/>semicolon expected.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:40.64" dur="00:00:03.23">Well, that makes sense because<br/>I told you I purposely left off</p>
    <p begin="00:03:43.87" dur="00:00:04.01">the semicolon in order<br/>to generate this mistake.</p>
    <p begin="00:03:47.88" dur="00:00:02.74">The error message then<br/>continues with the line</p>
    <p begin="00:03:50.62" dur="00:00:04.04">where the mistake is, System.out.println<br/>Answer is myAnswer,</p>
    <p begin="00:03:54.66" dur="00:00:03.05">and way over on the right<br/>there's a little carrot pointing</p>
    <p begin="00:03:57.71" dur="00:00:03.51">to the spot where Java<br/>noticed the mistake.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:01.22" dur="00:00:03.15">If you understand this error<br/>message, you can go back</p>
    <p begin="00:04:04.37" dur="00:00:02.77">into your program<br/>and add the semicolon</p>
    <p begin="00:04:07.14" dur="00:00:02.45">and now the problem is fixed.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:09.59" dur="00:00:02.64">You might then return<br/>to the Command Prompt,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:12.23" dur="00:00:03.90">type the compiling<br/>statement again, press Enter,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:16.13" dur="00:00:02.84">and this time there<br/>are no error messages</p>
    <p begin="00:04:18.97" dur="00:00:03.53">and you have a successful<br/>compile of the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:22.50" dur="00:00:02.95">The program has successfully<br/>been translated</p>
    <p begin="00:04:25.45" dur="00:00:02.57">into machine language.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:28.02" dur="00:00:04.16">After you have translated the<br/>code, you can test the program,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:32.18" dur="00:00:02.48">then put the program<br/>into production,</p>
    <p begin="00:04:34.66" dur="00:00:02.29">and then maintain the program.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:36.95" dur="00:00:04.34">We'll talk about these next<br/>3 steps in the next video.</p>
    <p begin="00:04:41.29" dur="00:00:01.68">Thanks for watching.</p>
