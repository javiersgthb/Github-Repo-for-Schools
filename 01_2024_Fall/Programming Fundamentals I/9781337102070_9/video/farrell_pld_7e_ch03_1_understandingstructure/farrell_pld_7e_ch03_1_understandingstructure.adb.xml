    <p begin="00:00:01.44" dur="00:00:01.38">This is Joyce Farrell.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:02.82" dur="00:00:02.35">Let's talk about structure.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:05.17" dur="00:00:03.33">Structured programming<br/>has three structures.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:08.50" dur="00:00:03.31">With the sequence structure,<br/>you enter the structure,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:11.81" dur="00:00:03.08">and then you perform<br/>one step after the other</p>
    <p begin="00:00:14.89" dur="00:00:03.03">for as many steps as it takes<br/>to accomplish a problem,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:17.92" dur="00:00:02.40">and then you exit the structure.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:20.32" dur="00:00:02.81">The second structure is<br/>a selection structure.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:23.13" dur="00:00:02.77">When you enter a selection,<br/>you ask a question.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:25.90" dur="00:00:03.01">If the answer is yes, you<br/>travel one logical path</p>
    <p begin="00:00:28.91" dur="00:00:03.63">of the selection, or when you<br/>enter the selection structure</p>
    <p begin="00:00:32.54" dur="00:00:02.68">and ask the question,<br/>if the answer is no,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:35.22" dur="00:00:03.20">you travel the other logical<br/>path of the structure.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:38.42" dur="00:00:03.33">Either way, you exit the<br/>structure when you're done.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:41.75" dur="00:00:01.99">The third structure is a loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:43.74" dur="00:00:02.70">When you enter a loop,<br/>you ask a question.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:46.44" dur="00:00:03.46">If the answer is yes, you<br/>execute the loop body,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:49.90" dur="00:00:02.32">and ask the question again.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:52.22" dur="00:00:03.67">If the answer is still yes, you<br/>execute the loop body again,</p>
    <p begin="00:00:55.89" dur="00:00:02.61">and ask the question again.</p>
    <p begin="00:00:58.50" dur="00:00:02.69">When the answer to the<br/>question is finally no,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:01.19" dur="00:00:02.84">you exit the loop structure.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:04.03" dur="00:00:03.40">The sequence structure has a<br/>single entry and exit point,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:07.43" dur="00:00:03.52">the selection structure has a<br/>single entry and exit point,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:10.95" dur="00:00:04.54">and the loop structure has a<br/>single entry and exit point.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:15.49" dur="00:00:02.93">You can combine structures<br/>in two ways.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:18.42" dur="00:00:04.41">You can use the entry and exit<br/>points to stack them end-to-end</p>
    <p begin="00:01:22.83" dur="00:00:02.36">to attach them to each other.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:25.19" dur="00:00:02.22">You can also nest structures</p>
    <p begin="00:01:27.41" dur="00:00:03.93">by placing any structure<br/>entirely inside another one</p>
    <p begin="00:01:31.34" dur="00:00:02.98">using those entry<br/>and exit points.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:34.32" dur="00:00:03.14">For example, you<br/>might have a sequence,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:37.46" dur="00:00:02.79">and you might stack<br/>it on top of a loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:40.25" dur="00:00:03.26">So you'd have a sequence<br/>followed by a loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:43.51" dur="00:00:04.11">You might have a sequence<br/>followed by a selection.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:47.62" dur="00:00:03.34">You might have a loop<br/>followed by a selection,</p>
    <p begin="00:01:50.96" dur="00:00:02.25">or you might have<br/>any other combination</p>
    <p begin="00:01:53.21" dur="00:00:03.28">of structures stacked<br/>end-to-end.</p>
    <p begin="00:01:56.49" dur="00:00:04.02">When you nest structures,<br/>you might have a selection,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:00.51" dur="00:00:03.09">you might have a sequence,<br/>and you can take the sequence</p>
    <p begin="00:02:03.60" dur="00:00:02.95">and nest it inside<br/>one-half of the selection.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:06.55" dur="00:00:04.73">You might have a<br/>loop and a selection,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:11.28" dur="00:00:05.69">and you might nest the selection<br/>entirely inside the loop.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:16.97" dur="00:00:03.77">The three structures,<br/>sequence, selection, and loop,</p>
    <p begin="00:02:20.74" dur="00:00:04.50">can be stacked and nested and<br/>combined in an infinite number</p>
    <p begin="00:02:25.24" dur="00:00:03.55">of ways, but the three<br/>of them alone can be used</p>
    <p begin="00:02:28.79" dur="00:00:04.12">to solve every programming<br/>problem.</p>
    <p begin="00:02:32.91" dur="00:00:00.95">Thanks for watching.</p>
